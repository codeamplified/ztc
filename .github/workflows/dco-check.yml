            This pull request contains commits that are not signed off. All commits must include a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) signature.
            
            **To fix this:**
            1. Sign your commits using \`git commit -s\`
            2. For existing commits, you can amend them: \`git commit --amend -s\`
            3. Force push your branch: \`git push --force-with-lease\`
            
            **Why DCO?**
            DCO ensures you have the legal right to contribute your code under our Apache 2.0 license. Learn more in our [Contributing Guide](../blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certificate-of-origin-dco).
            
            **Example:**
            \`\`\`bash
            git commit -s -m "feat(ansible): add support for custom storage classes"
            \`\`\`
            
            This adds a "Signed-off-by" line to your commit message automatically.`

## When to Use Vaultwarden

Choose Vaultwarden if you need:
- Browser auto-fill integration
- Mobile device access to credentials  
- Family/team credential sharing
- Professional password manager workflow
- Integration with Bitwarden ecosystem

Stick with ZTC built-in credentials if you:
- Only need system administrator access
- Prefer CLI-based credential management
- Want zero maintenance overhead
- Don't need browser/mobile integration

## Resource Usage

- **Memory**: 64Mi request, 256Mi limit
- **CPU**: 50m request, 200m limit  
- **Storage**: 5Gi (configurable)
- **Network**: HTTP only (HTTPS requires cert-manager)

## Security Notes

- **Signups**: Initially enabled for setup, consider disabling after account creation
- **Admin Token**: Optional but recommended for API access and automation
- **HTTPS**: Consider enabling TLS via cert-manager for production use
- **Backup**: Data stored on persistent volume, included in cluster backups

## Troubleshooting

### Browser HTTPS Requirement
Modern browsers require HTTPS for Vaultwarden's Web Crypto API:

```bash
# Option 1: Port forward to localhost (bypasses HTTPS requirement)
kubectl port-forward -n vaultwarden svc/vaultwarden 8082:80
# Then access: http://localhost:8082

# Option 2: Use Bitwarden mobile/desktop apps (work with HTTP)
# Configure server URL: http://vault.homelab.lan

# Option 3: Enable TLS via cert-manager (recommended for production)
# See ZTC documentation for TLS setup
```

### Cannot Create Account
- Ensure you use email format: `user@domain.com` (not just username)
- Check that signups are enabled (default: true)
- Verify Vaultwarden is accessible via ingress

### Pod Won't Start
- Check storage class availability: `kubectl get storageclass`
- Verify persistent volume claim: `kubectl get pvc -n vaultwarden`
- Check pod logs: `kubectl logs -n vaultwarden deployment/vaultwarden`

## Uninstall

```bash
make undeploy-workload WORKLOAD=vaultwarden
```

**Note**: This removes the application but preserves the persistent volume. To completely remove data, also delete the PVC:
```bash
kubectl delete pvc vaultwarden-data -n vaultwarden
```
